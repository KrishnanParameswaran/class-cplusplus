### Classes in C++

Class is a user-defined datatype which can hold similar functions and members and can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the building block of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

1) A class may have data members and member functions which define the behaviour of an object of the class
2) Data members are the data variables and member functions are functions used to manipulate these variables
3) An object is an instance of the class. When a class is created, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated memory is allocated
4) There are three types of access specifiers: private, protected and public 
5) Constructors are special class members that are automatically called every time an object of the class is created
6) Constructor will have same name as that of class
7) Use scope resolution (::) operator to define a member function outside the class definition
8) Use dot(.) operator together with object's name to access a member function
9) No need for format specifiers in print statements in C++ unlike C
10)Use string datatype if you expect whitespace in your character array

Compiling instructions: 
1) Download the .cpp file into a directory
2) Navigate into this directory from terminal or command line
3) Ensure to have g++ compiler installed and is added to system path
4) Compile using the command: g++ -g .\classPro.cpp
5) Type the .exe filename created and hit enter to see output
